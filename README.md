# Toy-Compiler-Backend
A simple educational compiler backend written in C that manually builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a tiny toy language and generates LLVM IR code. The project demonstrates the core concepts of code generation, producing runnable programs from basic language constructs like variables, arithmetic, and print statements.
